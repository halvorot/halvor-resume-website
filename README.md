# Halvor Teigen Resume Website

This project was implemented because I was curious about the frontend framework Astro and wanted to learn more about it.
I figured a resume/CV/portfolio website was a good place to start.

In addition to being a learning project, the website presents me as a software engineer and lists some of my experiences and capabilities.
